# djangae.contrib.search

This is a minimal search engine built on the Google Cloud Datastore
that in part mimics the old Google App Engine Search API.

It exists for two reasons:

1. An upgrade path from the GAE Search API.
2. To aid smaller projects that don't need to run their own ElasticSearch instance.
